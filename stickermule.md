## Stickermule

If you want to print stickers from [stickermule.com](https://www.stickermule.com/) just upload a PNG or SVG version as a 2x2 Die cut sticker. When Stickermule sends you a proof for approval, it'll be resized to `Custom 1.74" x 2" Die cut sticker` and will come out fine. Check out these [SVG tips](#svg_tips) for a hassle-free experience.

> Note: The *resized* size changed from `1.73"` to `1.74"` to accomodate the updated (09/2020) size requirements of `2521px`x`2911px`. Before 09/2020, stickers were resized to `Custom 1.73" x 2" Die cut sticker`. Stickers cut from each size can be intermingled.

**Step by step**

1) Go to [stickermule.com](https://www.stickermule.com/) and upload the artwork:

## SVG Tips

These two tips will solve 99% of the problems with turning SVG files into stickers.

* Specify colors as CMYK using the U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2 profile.
* Save a copy of your final sticker and convert all text to outlines to avoid font problems.
